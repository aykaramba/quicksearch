This is an attempt to test a quicksearch technique demonstrated in the following tutorial:

Tutorial Link: https://web-apps-in-lisp.github.io/isomorphic-web-frameworks/clog/index.html

Author of the tutorial: https://github.com/vindarel/

Almost no changes were made to the code, so most of the code and comments are by @vindarel with minor updates by me. I wanted to go through the tutorial, implement the code and see how a quick search based on keystroke input works, pack it into a system and prepare it for adding features. 

SPECIAL NOTE: If you get a chance, you should work through the original tutorial linked above because it demonstrates the use of live coding directly in the CLOG framework. CLOG is a powerful and mature framework with many features and the live coding feature should be experienced by everyone. I created this system for the purposes of
testing.

# INSTALLATION
